```
3. Copy the SSH key from this GitHub repository `git@github.com:deanssmart/the-vet-practice.git`

4. Run the following code in your command line to clone the repo to your machine (you can change the app-name to what you desire):

8. Copy the relevant Homestead files into the
project directory:

```shell 
vendor/bin/homestead make

9. Change the second line of Homestead.yaml so it just uses 512mb: 

```shell 
memory: 512
```

10. Create a .env file:
